### Module summary

The quantity, diversity and availability of transport data is increasing rapidly, requiring skills in the management and interrogation of data and databases.
Recent years have seen a new wave of 'big data' and 'data science' changing the world, with the Harvard Business Review describing Data Science as the 'sexiest job of the 21st century' (see [hbr.org](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)).
Transport researchers increasingly need to take data from a wide range of sources and perform non-standard analyses methods on them to inform the decision-making process.

Despite these developments the transport sector has been slow to adapt to new methods and workflows.
The Transport Systems Catapult, for example, identified a skills gap in "skilled technical talent capable of handling and analysing very large datasets compiled from multiple sources" (see [ts.catapult.org.uk](https://ts.catapult.org.uk/news-events-gallery/news/report-warns-of-uk-skills-shortage-in-im-sector/)).

This module takes a highly practical approach to learning about 'data science' tools and their application to investigating transport issues.
The focus is on:

- team work
- with real data
- using open source and effective tools
- to ensure scientific reproducibility and transparency in the decision-making process

### Objectives

- Understand the structure of transport datasets: spatial, temporal and demographic.
- Understand how to obtain, clean and store transport related data.
- Gain proficiency in command-line tools (primarily R) for handling large transport datasets.
- Experience in basic machine learning and modelling methods tools
- Produce data visualizations, static and interactive
- Understand 'big' data sources, the need for them, and how they differ from classical data sources
- Learn how to use these skills in a dynamic team environment, including project set-up and problem definition; team workflow; sourcing and interrogating data; applying statistical methods; visualising data and communicating the results.

### Learning outcomes

Students will become confident at working in data science teams working on transport problems; in selecting appropriate tools to answer societal and business questions with a range of input data types; and understanding the wider implications of the increasing use of data science for transport planning. 

Specifically, learning outcomes will include the ability to:

- Find appropriate questions to ask on a specific project, including in relation to ethical issues
- Identify available datasets and access and clean them
- Combine datasets from multiple sources
- Apply statistic modelling and machine learning techniques to understand input data
- Visualise and communicate the results of transport data science
- Articulate the relevance and limitations of data-centric analysis applied to transport problems, compared with other methods

### Syllabus 

- Practical data science with R
- The structure of transport data e.g. flows, incidents, origin/destination, GIS
- Accessing data from web sources
- Local and remote route assignment with remote routing services and locally installed software
- Data visualization
- Machine learning
- Professional and ethical issues of big data in transport Transport data analysis

### Pre-requisites

You will be expected to have a laptop with recent versions of R and RStudio installed.
See instructions here for getting an up-to-date R installation: https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#installing-r

It is also recommended that you install GitHub Deskto (or command line git on Linux and Mac), Docker, Python, QGIS and transport modelling tools such as SUMO but these are not essential.
