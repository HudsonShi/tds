## Overview

This course teaches two skill-sets that are fundamental in modern transport research: programming and data analytics. Combining these enables powerful transport planning and analysis workflows for tackling a wide range of problems, including:

- How to find, download and import a range of transport datasets?
- How to develop automated and reproducible transport planning workflows?
- How can increasingly available datasets on air quality, traffic and active travel be used to inform policy?
- How to visualise results in an attractive and potentially on-line and interactive manner?

This course will provide tools, code, data and, above all, face-to-face teaching to answer these questions and more, with the statistical programming language R.
The data science approach opens a world of possibilities for generating insight from your transport datasets.
The for researchers in the public sector, academia and industry.


## Learning objectives

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

- Find, download and import a variety of transport datasets, including from OpenStreetMap and government data portals
- Work with, analyse and model transport data with spatial, temporal and demographic attributes
- Work with air polution data in R and compare with transport behaviours
- Generate and analyse route networks for transport planning with reference to:
    - Origin-destination (OD) data
    - Geographic desire lines
    - Route allocation using different routing services
    - Route network generation and analysis
    
## Pre-requisites

Prior experience with transport datasets a pre-requisite for the course.
Attendees are expected to:

- Be comfortable with the use of R, using it for everyday data analysis tasks (you will find DataCamp's free [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) easy)
- Have experience with transport datasets and understand their structure (you will be familiar with the contents of the [Transport chapter](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/transport.html) in Geocomputation with R)

Participants are expected to brush-up on their knowledge before the course, for example by completing the exercises linked-to in the bullet points above.

In terms of **software**, with RStudio installed will be available for course attendees.
The following packages should be installed prior to attending the course:
However, for maximum benefit, **we recommend participants bring their own laptops**, with a recent version of R installed (3.5.0 or later).
Steps to set-up a suitable R/RStudio environment are described in sections [2.3](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#r-version) and [2.5](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html#rstudio) of the book [Efficient R Programming](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/set-up.html).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
  "openair",
  "osmdata",
  "sf",
  "stplanr",
  "tidyverse",
  "tmap"
))
```

You can test your computer is ready for the course by running these commands:

```{r}
library(osmdata)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
location = opq("leeds") %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Worsley Building") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()
route = sf::read_sf("https://git.io/fhnAr")
tm_shape(route) +
  tm_lines(col = "blue", lwd = 5) +
  tm_shape(location$osm_polygons) +
  tm_polygons(col = "red") +
  tm_view(basemaps = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap)
```


## Background reading

It would be useful if participants could acquaint themselves with the following resources.

- Efficient R Programming: (ERP for short, with section numbers linked e.g. ERP 1.5.2) is a book and online resource (at [csgillespie.github.io/efficientR](https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR)) on using R effectively (Gillespie and Lovelace 2016).

- Introducing stplanr: an introductory vignette on **stplanr**, accessible via the following command (assuming **stplanr** is installed):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("introducing-stplanr")
```

- R for Data Science (R4DS): A book and online resource we use to teach R objects (also of wider insterest): http://r4ds.had.co.nz

### Course tutors

**[Robin Lovelace](http://robinlovelace.net/)** is a researcher at the Leeds Institute for Transport Studies ([ITS](http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/)) and the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics ([LIDA](http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/about-lida/contact/)).
Robin has many years of experience of using R for academic
research and has taught numerous R courses at all levels.
He has developed popular R resources including
the popular books [Efficient R Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920047995.do) (Gillespie and Lovelace 2016),
[Spatial Microsimulation with R](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/spatial-microsim-book) (Lovelace and Dumont 2016), and
[Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/) (Lovelace et al. 2019).

These skills have been applied on a number of projects with real-world applications, including the [Propensity to Cycle Tool](http://www.pct.bike/), a nationally scalable interactive online mapping
application, and the [**stplanr**](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr) package.

**[James Tate](http://www.its.leeds.ac.uk/people/j.tate)** is a vehicle emissions and air quality expert focussing on the impacts of road transport on the environment. He has developed and deployed new approaches to survey and model the emission performance of the UK/ EU road transport fleet. James has been using R as the primary tool in his data analysis workflow for a decade and has developed popular modules teaching R to Master's students in ITS.
